The popularity of generative AI (Generative AI) has aroused widespread attention and completely ignited the vector database market. 

According to IDC's forecast, by 2025, more than 80% of business data will be unstructured, stored in text, image, audio, video or other formats. However, storing and querying unstructured data on a large scale is a very big challenge.

The common practice in the field of generative AI and deep learning is to store unstructured data by converting it into vectors, and to search for semantic relevance through vector similarity search (Vector similarity search) technology. Fast storage, indexing and searching of Embedding vectors are the core functions of vector databases.
